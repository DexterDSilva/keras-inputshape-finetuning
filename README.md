# Keras input shape finetuning using Colab

This is an example from [Pyimage](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2019/06/24/change-input-shape-dimensions-for-fine-tuning-with-keras/)

Learned how to deal with images of different dimensions.

I trained the model o Google Colab which offers free GPU training (https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html)

My trained model was100 epochs was 60Mb - too big for Github

So [ link to shared model on my drive colab-trained100-model.h5](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-YQgQMnAF5T1QufsdumaDFg-foyiaOHS/view?usp=sharing)
